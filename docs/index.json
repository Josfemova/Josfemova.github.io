I’m also working in some interesting science/data aquisition projects, so I will probably post about that when I get the time to do so. Basically, expect: MCU quickstart guides Posts about incredibly niche laboratory equipment drivers Random tech jargon and much more Did I mention I am a Rust advocate? O yeah, I’m going to post about that too, especially about developing stuff with the embedded ecosystem.

Translation is only required sometimes, and I have a thousand things to research, so we going spanglish. Do not tempt me to seriously start learning german because this will become a trilingual blog, and it’s way too much fun to simultaneously fail at three languages at the same time.

I’ve colaborated with the atsamd-rs people to mantain the ItsyBitsy M4 Rsut BSP up to date, you can check that project here here. Ofc, I only updated a bsp, nothing big really. I am currently working on a mdbook to teach programming on embedded systems using Rust and the ubiquitous ESP32, I’ll keep you posted. Eventually, it should join the esp-rs book but not completely. I also bought an EOS-S3 devboard, which means I will document the process of using it. Don’t hope for a complete starch-press-like guide, but I will try to get there from post to post. Might fuck around and create a Rust HAL for it eventually, but those who fuck around eventually find out, let’s hope the finding out part is easy on my hubris.
