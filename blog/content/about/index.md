## Colaborating with OSS

I'm currently developing Tarantulab with a colleague, [check it out!](https://gitlab.com/tarantulab).

I've colaborated with the `atsamd-rs` people to mantain the ItsyBitsy M4 Rsut BSP up to date, you can check that project here [here](https://github.com/atsamd-rs/atsamd). Ofc, I only updated a bsp, nothing big really.

I am currently working on a mdbook to teach programming on embedded systems using Rust and the ubiquitous ESP32, I'll keep you posted. Eventually, it should join the [`esp-rs` book](https://esp-rs.github.io/book/) but not completely.  

I also bought an EOS-S3 devboard, which means I will document the process of using it. Don't hope for a complete starch-press-like guide, but I will try to get there from post to post. Might fuck around and create a Rust HAL for it eventually, but those who fuck around eventually find out, let's hope the finding out part is easy on my hubris.

## I've made some learning material...perhaps you want to check that?
