## Why I made this blog

I need a place to you know...blog about stuff I do, so naturally, I searched for a hugo theme that I liked and welp...here we are.

## What to expect

I do a lot of stuff with different microcontrollers, and I'm planning on doing some guides with some of them. I'm also working in some interesting science/data aquisition projects, so I will probably post about that when I get the time to do so. 

Basically, expect:

- MCU quickstart guides
- Posts about incredibly niche laboratory equipment drivers
- Random tech jargon
- and much more

Did I mention I am a Rust advocate? O yeah, I'm going to post about that too, especially about developing stuff with the embedded ecosystem.

## On the language of this blog

I know there are settings in the template that allow me to use both, spanish and english, but quite honestly, that's too much work. Translation is only required sometimes, and I have a thousand things to research, so we going spanglish. Do not tempt me to seriously start learning german because this will become a trilingual blog, and it's way too much fun to simultaneously fail at three languages at the same time.
